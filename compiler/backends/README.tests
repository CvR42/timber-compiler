Running tests.


Tests using threads can be run without any setups neccessary.


Tests using lam(a mpi version) need the following:
To start lam do:
	lamboot
This uses 1 processor, as defined in /usr/local/lam/boot/bhost.def.
If you want to use more processors do:
	lamboot <hostfile>
where <hostfile> is one of the .def files in /usr/local/lam/boot.
To kill of lam in other to reach a known state use:
	wipe <hostfile>
Important: the lam package should be in your .register file, and the
mpi package should not be in there to avoid conflicts.


Tests using pvm need a running pvm daemon. To do this call
	pvm
this gives you a prompt where you can type in help for more info.
Just add as many processors as you like and exit using <ctrl>-D.
You can then run your programs. When finished you can enter the pvm
program again and kill pvm using the kill command.
