For the moment, installation is quite messy.

- The 'spar' compiler driver script assumes that the Vnus backend is
avialable in a fixed path relative from the current directory. Please
only run the compiler from the directory it resides in.

- To find the sources that must be compiled in the paths in SPARPATH
are searched. Please just set these with:

setenv SPARPATH /home/falcon/reeuwijk/java:/home/falcon/reeuwijk/timber/frontends:/home/falcon/reeuwijk/java-1.1
