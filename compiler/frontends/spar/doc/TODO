- Document SPARPATH. Default SPARPATH is ".".

- Explain that as an extension to Java, Spar allows global
  variables and methods in each package. They are implicitly
  static. This package is an outer class to each class in the
  package. Their qualified name is the obvious. This does not
  clash with Java naming conventions.

- Explain the restrictions that can be enforced through the
  command line:
  - No complex numbers.
  - No multidim & elastic arrays.
  - No pragmas.
  - No delete.
  - No parallel constructs.
  - No macros.
  - No print statements.
  - No cardinality lists.

Most of them are implemented by selectively ignoring certain
keywords and tokens.
