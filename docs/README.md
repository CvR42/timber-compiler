This directory contains the pages of the Timber compiler website.

See [here](https://cvr42.github.io/timber-compiler/index.html) for
the GitHub hosted website.

All the html pages are generated from perl scripts that generate navigation
around a kernel page. The generated html pages are also in GitHub so that
the GitHub hosting works.
