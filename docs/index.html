<h1>The Timber compiler</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
The Timber compiler is a parallelizing static compiler for a superset of Java.
</p>
<p>
The Timber compiler has been developed to demonstrate, and experiment
with, compilation techniques for parallel and distributed systems.
Our research concentrates on annotation-based parallel programming,
so that is what the compiler supports. To provide a realistic context
for parallelization engines, sufficient optimizations for sequential
programs have been implemented to achieve a respectable level of
performance for sequential programs.
</p>
<p>
The compiler implements most of Java, plus a set of additional language
constructs for scientific programming. This set of extensions is called
<em>Spar</em>. We only fundamentally deviate from the Java language
specification on the following points:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The compiler is a whole-program static compiler from Java/Spar source code
to machine code, so JVM bytecode is not supported. In particular, dynamic
class loading is not supported.</li>
<li>Java threads are not supported. Instead, we provide our own
language constructs for parallel programming.</li>
<li>The <a href="spar/overview.html">Spar language extensions</a> introduce a number of additional keywords.
</li>
</ul>
The additional language constructs are only recognized in files with
the extension <code>.spar</code>. For code in <code>.java</code> and
<code>.jav</code> files, the compiler behaves pretty much like an ordinary
Java compiler. In fact, for the <a href="jacks.html">Jacks validation
suite</a>, we have pretty much the same score as Sun's own compiler!


<h2>Downloading</h2>
<p>
The compiler is available for downloading under the Gnu Public License
(GPL). See the <a href="downloading.html">downloading</a> page for
further details.
